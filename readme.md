## SimplePhpUpload
This file will help you upload Wordpress (or any other file) to your php webhost/server without uploading it from your own computer.
Just a normal file_put_contents() and nothing else!
If you're look for an advanced PHP downloader head to https://github.com/kapilks/Web-Based-Download-Manager
#### Don't forget to delete it after you've downloaded your wordpress, otherwise will cause a huge security issue if anyone get access to this.
